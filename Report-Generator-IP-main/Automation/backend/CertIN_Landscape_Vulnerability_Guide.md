# Cert-IN Landscape Vulnerability Report Generator Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the updated Cert-IN Report Generator with landscape-oriented vulnerability boxes and simplified PoC image handling.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Landscape-Oriented Vulnerability Boxes**
- Dynamic vulnerability boxes similar to type2.py but in landscape mode
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Professional layout matching your requirements

### 📁 **Simplified PoC Image Handling**
- Upload a single zip file containing all PoC images
- Automatic mapping to observations based on step numbers
- No need for complex naming conventions

## How It Works

### 1. **Excel File Structure**
Your `certin_vulnerability_format.xlsx` should have these columns:

| Column Name | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Vulnerability_ID | Unique identifier | OBS-001 |
| Severity | Severity level | Critical, High, Medium, Low |
| Status | Current status | Open, Closed |
| CVE_CWE | CVE/CWE reference | CWE-284 |
| CVSS | CVSS score | 8.7 |
| CVSS_Vector | CVSS vector string | 4.0/AV:N/AC:L/... |
| Affected_Asset | URL or IP address | https://example.com |
| Vulnerability_Title | Short title | SQL Injection in Login |
| Detailed_Description | Full description | The login page is vulnerable... |
| Impact | Impact statement | Attackers can bypass authentication... |
| Recommendations | Remediation steps | Use parameterized queries... |
| Reproduction_Steps | Steps to reproduce | 1. Access login page... |

### 2. **PoC Image Structure**
Upload a single zip file containing all PoC images:

```
poc_images.zip
├── step1.png (First step of Observation #1)
├── step2.png (Second step of Observation #1)
├── step3.png (First step of Observation #2)
├── step4.png (Second step of Observation #2)
├── step5.png (First step of Observation #3)
└── ... (as many steps as needed)
```

### 3. **Automatic Mapping**
The system automatically maps images to observations:
- **Observation #1**: step1.png, step2.png, step3.png, etc.
- **Observation #2**: Next set of step images
- **Observation #3**: Next set of step images
- And so on...

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
1. **Excel File**: Fill your `certin_vulnerability_format.xlsx` with vulnerability data
2. **PoC Images**: Create a zip file with all PoC images named step1.png, step2.png, etc.

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Go to `/type3/` in your browser
2. Fill out the document control form
3. Upload your Excel file in the vulnerability section
4. Upload your PoC zip file
5. Click "Generate Cert-IN Report"

### Step 3: Generate Report
The system will:
1. Process your Excel data
2. Extract and map PoC images
3. Create landscape-oriented vulnerability boxes
4. Generate the final report

## Vulnerability Box Layout

Each vulnerability box includes:

### Header Section
- **Observation Number**: #1, #2, #3, etc.
- **Severity**: Color-coded (Critical=Red, High=Red, Medium=Yellow, Low=Green, Informational=Blue)
- **Status**: Open, Closed, etc.

### Details Section
- **CVE/CWE**: Vulnerability reference
- **CVSS**: Score and vector
- **Affected Asset**: URL or IP
- **Vulnerability Title**: Short description
- **Detailed Description**: Full explanation
- **Impact**: Business impact
- **Recommendations**: Numbered list of remediation steps
- **Proof of Concept**: Step-by-step with images

### PoC Images
- Automatically embedded in the report
- Centered and properly sized
- Missing images show "[Image missing: filename]"

## Template Variables

Add these variables to your `CSS Certin temp.docx` template:

### Document Control Variables
```
{{CLIENT_NAME}} - Client Name
{{REPORT_NAME}} - Report Name
{{DOCUMENT_TITLE}} - Document Title
{{DOCUMENT_ID}} - Document ID
{{PREPARED_BY}} - Prepared by
{{REVIEWED_BY}} - Reviewed by
{{APPROVED_BY}} - Approved by
{{RELEASED_BY}} - Released by
{{RELEASE_DATE}} - Release Date
```

### Vulnerability Variables
```
{{HAS_VULNERABILITIES}} - Boolean: true if vulnerabilities exist
{{VULNERABILITY_COUNT}} - Total number of vulnerabilities
```

## File Structure Example

```
Your Project/
├── certin_vulnerability_format.xlsx (vulnerability data)
├── poc_images.zip (all PoC images)
│   ├── step1.png
│   ├── step2.png
│   ├── step3.png
│   └── step4.png
└── CSS Certin temp.docx (Word template)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Images not showing**: Check that images are named step1.png, step2.png, etc.
2. **Variables not replaced**: Ensure exact variable names in template
3. **Empty vulnerability sections**: Check Excel file has required columns

### Debug Tips
1. Test with simple data first
2. Check Excel file structure matches requirements
3. Verify PoC zip file contains properly named images
4. Test template with sample data

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check variable names match exactly
2. Verify Excel file has all required columns
3. Ensure PoC images follow naming convention
4. Test with minimal data first
